!
! This is a GPMDOC6 version of the MACRO SPITBOL Manual for VAX/VMS.
! It is substantially modified translation of the Runoff version
! produced by Dave Shields for the PDP11 Runoff.  It produces everything
! including an index, table of contents and a .HLP Help file.

! Revision history:
! -----------------
!
{Set Versionid,ABAA-6734}
{Set Revid,D}
! Rev. D: 08-AUG-1981 [SGD]:
! o Fixed description of /LIST /NOLIST /OUTPUT and /NOOUTPUT to
!   conform to new semantics.  LOADSTACK message removed as no longer
!   in existance. /CRC and /NOCRC documented.
!
! Rev. C: 30-JUL-1981 [SGD]:
! o Changed description of recommended link to reflect ABAA-4521 patch
!   which avoids need for /NOTRACE.
!
! Rev. B: 19-JUL-1981 [SGD]:
! o Fixed manual to reflect that delivery no longer includes SPITBOL image.
!   This image is built during delivery.
! o Added {Revid} macro to provide manual revision level.

! the current level string (n.m form).
!
! The number,title and page is entered on the TOC1 stack for the table of
! content printing at the end.  A level of 1 forces a new page with a
! spiffy title block. Level 2 stuff is nicely underlined.
! Lower level stuff is left to troglodytes.

1 SPITBOL{brk}
{Tset.Add1 Lmg}
{Nfj}
Invokes the MACRO SPITBOL (SNOBOL4) interpreter.

Format:

        SPITBOL  file-spec

{Brk}{Restore Lmg}
{Fj}
2 Parameters{Brk}
file-spec{brk}
{Tset.Add1 Lmg}
A legal file specification designating the input file for SPITBOL without
wild cards.
 Only one file can be designated for file-spec.
 No logical concatenation via "+" or successive processing via "," is
supported.
{Brk}{restore Lmg}
2 Qualifiers{Brk}
/CRC (D){Brk}
/NOCRC{Brk}
{Tset.Add1 Lmg}
This switch is only meaningful on a /LOAD=... operation, where the
specification of /NOCRC will bypass the cyclic reducdancy check of
the SPITBOL code region.
 The purpose of this check is to insure that the version of SPITBOL
being used is the same as the version under which the exit module was
saved.
 As SPITBOL also checks version identification data and other parameters,
the overhead for this check may be considered unnecessary for frequently
used load modules.
 In such cases, /NOCRC can be profitably specified.
{Brk}{Restore Lmg}
/CSTATS (D){Brk}
/NOCSTATS{Brk}
{Tset.Add1 Lmg}
This switch will enable/disable the printing of compilation
statistics on the output file.
 If /NOLIST has been specified, the default is /NOCSTATS.
{Brk}{Restore Lmg}
/ESTATS (D){Brk}
/NOESTATS{Brk}
{Tset.Add1 Lmg}
This switch will suppress the printing of execution
statistics on the output file.
 If /NOLIST has been specified, then the default is /NOESTATS.
{Brk}{Restore Lmg}
/EXECUTE (D){Brk}
/NOEXECUTE{Brk}
{Tset.Add1 Lmg}
This switch has the same logical effect as a
-NOEXECUTE control card in the source program.
 SPITBOL will process the source program, and then exit with a
message that Execution Was Suppressed.
{Brk}{Restore Lmg}
/LIST[=filename] (/LIST=Inputfile.LIS (D)){Brk}
/NOLIST{Brk}
{Tset.Add1 Lmg}
The /LIST switch allows specification of the filename for the
standard output channel.
 If a terminal device is specified for the /LIST switch,
then form feeds in the program listing will be suppressed.
 The default device and account for this file is the same as that under
which SPITBOL is being run.
 The default name for the output file is the input file's name, and
the default extension is ".LIS".
 The program listing and compilation statistics are sent to this file.
 If neither of /OUTPUT=... or /NOOUTPUT are also specified on the command
line, then execution output is also directed to this file.
 This includes OUTPUT assigned text and TRACE and DUMP output.
{Ls 1}The /NOLIST switch indicates that source listing is not to be generated.
/NOLIST also causes an implicit /NOESTATS and /NOCSTATS.
 Note that the appearance of /NOLIST does not mean that
no output will be sent to the standard output channel.
 However, if the program makes no reference to the standard output channel,
then if /NOLIST is specified, this channel will never be opened.
{Ls 1}/LIST with no filename inverts the effect of a previous /NOLIST spec.
 That is, enables source listing and compilation statistics.
{Brk}{Restore Lmg}
/MINC=nnn (MINC=20 (D)){brk}
{Brk}{Tset.Add1 Lmg}
This switch controls the number of pages by which
SPITBOL's working store is expanded when it becomes exhausted.
 Under normal circumstances, it should not be necessary to specify
this switch, however, "/MINC=0" will prevent any additional allocation
to SPITBOL past the MINT allocation, and may thus be useful in
preventing the unrestrained growth of the interpreter.
{Brk}{Restore Lmg}
/MINT=nnn (MINT=200 (D)){Brk}
{Tset.Add1 Lmg}
This switch controls the amount of virtual memory
(in 512 Byte pages) that will be initally allocated for SPITBOL's
working storage areas.
 The SPITBOL VMS interface is designed to permit these working storage
areas to grow indefinitely, as long as the region remains contiguous,
and there are pages available in the process' virtual quota.
 However, SPITBOL will not request additional memory from VMS unless
it cannot get enough by regenerating its existing store.
 So, this switch may be useful in some situations
to avoid garbage collector thrashing.
{Ls 1}The default for this switch is "/MINT=200" which is equivalent to
about 100K bytes, or 25,000 SPITBOL 'words' (VAX Longwords).
 Stack space is not included in the MINT allocation, instead,
stack is allocated by SPITBOL as needed.
{Brk}{Restore Lmg}
/OUTPUT[=Filename] (/OUTPUT (D)){brk}
/NOOUTPUT{Brk}
{Tset.Add1 Lmg}
 The /OUTPUT=filename switch requests an alternate file for the
standard output channel at execution time.  If this switch is not specified,
then execution output is directed at the same file as the source listing
(/LIST=filename).
 This file is not opened until execution begins.
 If at that time the channel cannot be opened, SPITBOL exits with a
fatal status.
{Ls 1}/NOOUTPUT directs any execution-time references to the standard
output channel to the null device (NL:)
{Ls 1}/OUTPUT with no filename restores the default condition.
 That is, execution output is appended to the listing output.
{Ls 1}Note that /OUTPUT and /LIST are not synonymous.
{Brk}{Restore Lmg}
/PAGE (D){Brk}
/NOPAGE{brk}
{Tset.Add1 Lmg}
If this switch is specified, page separators in
the source listing and statistics will be a few blank lines, instead of
form feeds.
 "/PAGE" is the default, unless the standard output channel
is a terminal, in which case "/NOPAGE" is the default.
{Brk}{Restore Lmg}
/WARN (D){Brk}
/NOWARN{Brk}
{Tset.Add1 Lmg}
When /NOWARN is indicated on the command line, only errors and severe
errors in the VMS interface logic will be reported on SYS$ERROR.
 This can be useful to suppress messages regarding source line truncation,
exit module saves and similar messages.
/WARN, the default, causes reporting of such conditions.
{Ls 1}This switch does not affect in any way SPITBOL's handling of errors with
respect to the program.
{Brk}{Restore Lmg}
/WIDTH=nnn{brk}
{Tset.Add1 Lmg}
SPITBOL attempts to compute a proper width for the standard output file.
 The switch "/WIDTH=n" can be used to override any default.
 Otherwise, if the output device is record-oriented (including
spooled files), the default is the buffer for the device as
indicated by VMS.
 If the buffer size cannot be obtained, or is outside the range
[0..255], then a final default of 132 (decimal) is applied.
